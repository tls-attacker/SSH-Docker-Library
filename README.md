# SSH Docker Library

## Quickstart

First, you need to decide which SSH server you want to start.
You can get a list of supported services using the following command:

    $ docker compose config --services
    openssh-7.0p1
    openssh-7.1p1
    openssh-7.1p2
    openssh-7.2p1
    openssh-7.2p2
    openssh-7.3p1
    [...]

Now, you can start start a service:

    $ docker compose up openssh-7.2p1 --build --detach
    [+] Running 1/1
    â ¿ Container ssh-docker-library-openssh-7.2p1-1  Started

To connect to it from the docker host, you need to know which port on the host machine is mapped to the SSH port (22) of the container:

    $ docker compose port openssh-7.2p1 22
    0.0.0.0:22203

After determining the correct port, you can connect to the SSH server using the `ssh` command from the docker host:

    $ ssh -p 22203 sshattacker@172.17.0.1
    The authenticity of host '[172.17.0.1]:22203 ([172.17.0.1]:22203)' can't be established.
    ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:G3hVr1Zn4TpUoyd5zqqdn55zgpLUa2UV7V3w1+9KRUQ.
    This key is not known by any other names
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

## Building

You can easily build the different Docker images using [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

    $ docker compose up openssh-7.2p1

To modify the build, you can edit the [`docker-compose.yml` configuration file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) (or rather [add a `docker-compose.override.yml`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files) file).
For more details, please refer to the official Docker documentation.

Alternatively, you can also use `docker build` directly:

    $ docker build --tag openssh:7.2p1 --build-arg VERSION=7.2p1 images/openssh-7.x/
    Sending build context to Docker daemon  11.78kB
    Step 1/27 : FROM alpine:latest AS openssh-downloader
     ---> 9c6f07244728
    [...]

### Build Arguments

The docker images can be customized by [variables that can be overridden at build-time](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#set-build-time-variables---build-arg):

| Build-Time Variable    | Default Value   | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USERNAME`             | `sshattacker`   | SSH username                                                                                                                      |
| `PASSWORD`             | `bydahirsch`    | SSH password (if password authentication is supported by the server)                                                              |
| `AUTHORIZED_KEYS_FILE` | `id_ed2219.pub` | Path to file in Docker build context that is used as `authorized_keys` file (if pubkey authentication is supported by the server) |
| `WITH_NONE_CIPHER`     | `1`             | Whether to apply patch to enable the `none` cipher, set to `0` to disable _(OpenSSH only)_                                        |

### Example

Here is how to build everything and then to connect to each server with each key.

```
$ docker compose up --build
$ for service in $(docker compose config --services); do port="$(docker compose port "$service" 22 | cut -f2 -d:)"; for key in id_rsa id_ecdsa id_ed25519; do ssh -i "$key" -p "$port" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o PasswordAuthentication=no sshattacker@172.17.0.1 echo "$service: login succeeded using $key" || echo "$service: login failed using $key"; done; done
```
